## Introducing Mande Network’s Incentivized Testnet-2

Join and Earn Tokens Worth 5% of Pre-Genesis Pool
We are excited to announce the launch of Mande Network’s incentivised Testnet-2, a major milestone in our journey towards building a decentralised blockchain network that is built for credibility and trust. This testnet is designed to help us gather important feedback from the community, and to incentivize validators, users who participate in voting on the chain, credibility issuers and DaaP builders on chain with tokens worth 5% of our pre-genesis pool.


MAND tokens as Imagined by MidJourney AI
Our vision for Mande Network is to create a blockchain platform to enable credibility for web3. In a world where trust is becoming increasingly important, we believe that there is a real need for a decentralised network that puts credibility at the forefront.

To achieve this, we are building a Proof-of-Credibility (PoC) consensus mechanism that rewards validators for demonstrating their credibility and penalises bad actors who try to undermine the network. Mande chain testnet-2 also ships with Infra to support DiDs(Decentralised Identifiers) & VCs(Verifiable Credentials), SBTs(Soul Bound tokens) and ships with the full version of “PoC”(Proof-of-Credibility) consensus.

Our incentivised Testnet-2 is an important step towards achieving our vision of “building a credibility layer for web3”. By participating in the testnet, you will be helping us to identify any issues or bugs in our network, help us test PoC, DiDs & VCs, SBTs and DAppS.

While helping, you also get to earn tokens for your contributions. These tokens are worth 5% of our pre-genesis pool, making them a valuable reward for anyone who is interested in joining the Mande Network community.

We are looking for validators who can help us to maintain the network, users who can participate in voting on the chain, credibility issuers who can issue VCs & SBTs to improve the credibility of the network, and DaaP builders who can create new applications on the chain. If you are interested in any of these roles, we encourage you to join our incentivised Testnet-2.

Here is how the rewards will be distributed:

1% to validators: Up to 100 validators can get validator rewards for participating in the network and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. Validators will earn tokens for validating transactions and blocks on the chain.
1% to users for voting: Up to 1000 users can get voting rewards for participating in the network by voting on proposals and helping to shape the direction of the network. Users will earn tokens for casting their votes.
1% to credibility agents: Up to 100 credibility agents who issue certificates can get rewards for helping to maintain and improve the credibility of the network. Credibility agents will earn tokens for issuing certificates and verifying the credibility of users and transactions on the chain.
1% to active community members: Up to 1000 active community members can get a community airdrop for participating in the network by contributing to discussions and sharing their ideas. Active community members will earn tokens for their contributions to the network.
1% to developers who test smart contracts: Up to 25 developers can get rewards for building and testing smart contracts on the chain. Developers will earn tokens for creating and testing smart contracts that can be used on the Mande Network.
To get started, you can visit our website and join our discord server. Once you are part of our discord server, you can join the testnet and start participating in the network. We will be monitoring the network closely and providing support to all participants.

We believe that Mande Network has the potential to revolutionize the blockchain industry, and we are excited to take this next step towards making our vision a reality. Join our incentivized Testnet-2 today and help us to build a more credible and trustworthy Web3.
